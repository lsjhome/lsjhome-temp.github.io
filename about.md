Welcome to my blog! 

I'm Jin and I had been working as Data Scientist / Machine Learning Enginner for 2 years and more. and I'll start my master's degree in Statistics at Columbia University on Fall 2019.

To become a competitive Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer, I believe strong algorithmic and programming skills, the knowledge of big data platform, the familiarity of cloud platforms are essentials as well as a good knowledge of Statistics. I made this blog to make myself better Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer and share the experience and tips.

Data Scientist is pretty broad term.Â I'm interested in building practical products or solution that requires Machine Learning. My interest is not limited by certain domain, but I'm particularly interested in applying NLP to real world problems.
